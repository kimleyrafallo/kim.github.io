Welcome to **Zero to Bugs** — a personal dev blog where I document my journey in tech.

This site is where I explore the inner workings of **Java**, **Spring**, **Git**, and other technologies that interest me. I enjoy diving deep into how things work and learning by building real projects — even if it means getting stuck sometimes.

The goal? To gain a better understanding of the tools I use, improve as a developer, and share what I learn along the way — one bug fix at a time.

**Why "Zero to Bugs"?**  
Because every line of code starts from zero — and every learning journey includes a few bugs. I'm not here to teach; I'm here to learn out loud.
